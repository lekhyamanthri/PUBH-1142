    "##### <span style=\"color: orange;\">**Answer**: This was a case regarding the misuse of individual health data. Researchers approached this tribe to conduct a study regarding the tribe's high prevalence in Type 2 diabetes. The researchers collected their blood samples for further research, and although they assured them the samples would be used to investigate diabetes within the tribe's community, the researchers used the blood samples for additional studies without any further consent. \n",

    "##### <span style=\"color: blue;\">**Answer**: A spreadsheet is a file made of rows and columns that help organize data efficiently. Spreadsheets are a popular choice because they are easy to use and can be used for tasks like data entry or data analysis (two tasks that are very widely followed in the field of health data management). On the other hand, a database is a structured set of data. It is a collection of information that can be easily managed. Databases can store health data about individuals in an organized manner. Databases are managed by a Database Management System, which provides users with the tools to edit data or generate reports (regarding health, or anything else.)\n"

The secondary interest could be personal, financial, political, etc. "

    "##### <span style=\"color: pink;\">**Answer**: The role of independent oversight in managing conflicts of interest in public health research is that it involves having a seperate committee review research proposals for potential conflicts, monitor outgoing research or review findings before publication. Independent oversight can provide an additional layer of scrutiny and help ensure that conflicts of interest do not compromise the research. \n",
